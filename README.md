Gilded Rose Kata
===============================

This kata was sourced from [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). The aim is a to a add a new feature to the existing code, via refactoring.

## Technologies Used
* JavaScript
* Jasmine

## Notes on approach

The approach I ended up using to solve the kata was fairly simple. Write tests for the legacy code, ensuring that I get full coverage.
Having done that, write new and more changeable code which satisfies these tests, before adding on the additional functionality.

I didn't take this approach straight away, but rather tried to incrementally change the legacy code. I think this method could work, and I think I learnt things trying it,
but the approach definitely seems less time efficient than what I ended up doing (probably because the existing legacy code was so poor).
